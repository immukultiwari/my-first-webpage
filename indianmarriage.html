    <h2 id="INTRODUCTION" style="color: maroon;">Introduction to Indian Rituals</h2>
    <p>India is a land of rich traditions where rituals hold deep cultural and spiritual significance. These rituals, often rooted in ancient scriptures like the Vedas and Puranas, are seen as a way to connect with the divine, purify the mind and body, and bring harmony to life. From daily prayers and seasonal festivals to life-cycle ceremonies, rituals form an inseparable part of Indian society. They are usually accompanied by chanting of mantras, lighting of lamps, and offerings that symbolize devotion, prosperity, and well-being.</p>

    <h2 id="DivineUnion" style="color: maroon;">Marriage – A Divine Union</h2>
    <p>Among all rituals, marriage (Vivaha) holds supreme importance. It is not merely a social contract but a samskara (sacrament) — one of the sixteen most vital rites of passage in Hindu tradition. The Rigveda describes marriage as the sacred bond of two souls who promise to walk the path of dharma together. In the Manusmriti, marriage is regarded as the means by which man and woman fulfill their duties towards ancestors, gods, and society. Thus, it is believed that a wedding is not arranged by humans but written in destiny by the cosmic will.</p>

    <h2 id="Importance" style="color: maroon;">Religious Importance of Marriage</h2>
    <p>Marriage is often described as a spiritual yagna (sacred fire sacrifice). The fire god (Agni) is invoked as the divine witness to the vows taken by the bride and groom. Each ritual — from kanyadaan (gift of the daughter) to saptapadi (seven steps around the holy fire) — carries profound symbolic meaning. The couple prays not only for prosperity and children but also for friendship, loyalty, and shared devotion towards dharma. The Grihastha Ashrama (householder stage) begins with marriage, which sustains the cycle of family, society, and religion itself.</p>

    <h2 id="Mythology" style="color: maroon;">Mythological Roots and Symbolism</h2>
    <p>Ancient texts and legends abound with divine marriages that inspire earthly unions. Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati’s marriage is celebrated as the union of cosmic energy (Shakti) and consciousness (Shiva). Similarly, the wedding of Lord Rama and Sita in the Ramayana is revered as an ideal of love, virtue, and duty. These mythological references remind devotees that marriage is not simply about companionship, but about balancing universal forces and upholding righteousness (dharma).</p>

    <h2 id="Journey" style="color: maroon;">Marriage as a Sacred Journey</h2>
    <p>Indian marriage is not the end but the beginning of a lifelong journey. The seven steps around the sacred fire symbolize seven promises — from nourishment and strength to mutual respect and eternal friendship. It is believed that the bond created in marriage continues even beyond this life, carrying into future births. Thus, the institution of marriage in India is revered not only as a personal milestone but as a divine covenant between souls and the eternal universe.</p>

    <h2 id="Conclusion" style="color: maroon;">Conclusion – A New Beginning</h2>
    <p>Though we call it a ‘Conclusion,’ in truth an Indian marriage is never an ending—it is the start of an eternal journey. What looks like the final page of a story is in fact the prologue of another. The rituals may end, the guests may leave, but the union of two souls continues to write new chapters every day. In the cosmic script, marriage is less of a closing ceremony and more of a divine launch, reminding us that in India, even the conclusion is just another beginning. For where vows are taken under the sacred fire, destiny itself becomes the witness. And so, the story of two lives does not end here—it only spreads its roots into forever.</p>
